"""Adds signals to ``django.db.transaction``.

Signals are monkey patched into ``django.db.transaction``:

* ``post_commit``: sent after a transaction is committed. If no changes were
  made in the transaction block, nothing is committed and this won't be sent.
* ``post_rollback``: sent after a transaction is rolled back.
* ``post_transaction_management``: sent after leaving transaction management.
  This signal isn't  posted if a ``TransactionManagementError`` is raised.

.. code-block:: python

    import djcelery_transactions.transaction_signals


    def _post_commit(**kwargs):
        print "The transaction has been committed!"


    django.db.transaction.signals.post_commit.connect(_post_commit)

This code was inspired by GrÃ©goire Cachet's implementation of similar
functionality, which can be found on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/247844

.. warning::

    This module must be imported before you attempt to use the signals.
